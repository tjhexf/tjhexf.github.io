<p>A great, longer than i expected, RPG about Lesbian Animals going on adventures and getting past emotional trauma while also saving the world in the process. <br>
It has a lot more narrative weight than i ever thought it would have, the impact on my soul will be remembered forever.<br>
The soundtrack is great, the comedy is on point. Go play it dummy!</p><br>

    A game i didn't expect for me to like, seeing that i mostly play Yuri or Lesbian Visual Novels.
    However, Katawa shoujo managed to surprise me so, so much.<br><br>
    First off, it's a miracle this game came out this way, it was made from random 4chan contributors
    in the early days of indie gaming. <br>
    Somehow, it really does not feel like a 4chan creation. It genuinely has some of the
    most heartfelt and respectful discussion and exploration into disability and disabled people
    that i've seen in a game.<br><br>
    The protagonist, Hisao, is a fully colored character, instead of a cardboard self-insert,
    and his long self-reflections on how he feels about being disabled and how it changes
    his view of both himself and the friends and potential lover around him still haunts me in a good way.<br><br>
    Go play it, it's completely free, has fan mobile ports, but be wary of the optional NSFW content.

<h2>>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</h2><br>

<p>
    A very short, but delightful little game. It focuses on the mystery of a 
    stolen salami lunch, that has to be solved by a duck detective who is divorced,
    depressed and addicted to bread. <br><br>

    Not only is this game's artstyle so cute and endearing, it definitely won me
    over with the native linux support, and the amazing voice acting.
    Seriously, the Duck Detective's incredibly raspy and serious voice acting
    is just, something else, it's hilarious and carried the experience so much
    for me.

    Just a fun experience all around, with around an hour of play time. It's very short,
    but it makes me excited to see what the developers will do in the future!<br><br>

    After this i really want to see more Duck Detective games. This little guy is something
    else. I definitely won't forget this so soon.

<p>
    So, i entered this game thinking it would be a murder investigation game (which i'm suuuper into)
    because of the blood being wiped in the game's banner art. I was pleasantly
    suprised when it turned into something entirely else, and left me with a lot of stimming and
    embarassing noises aswell as fiery emotions. <br><br>

    I am not going to give any more spoilers, but you know from the other games in this list,
    that if i recommend a game, it's likely because it has a lot of gay.

    <br><br>
    Go play it, you won't be disappointed.
