<h1>Jolene's Favorite Videogames List!</h1>
<p>This is a super minimal html like just some bytes, so i can store my favorite games list :3</p>

<p>Not Actually Ordered by the way, i'm just placing games as i go along and remember or play them</p>

<p>The List:</p><br>

<a href="https://ponett.itch.io/slarpg">>Super Lesbian Animal RPG</a><br>
<img src="animalRPG.webp" alt="Super Lesbian Animal RPG LOGO" class="center"> 

<p>A great, longer than i expected, RPG about Lesbian Animals going on adventures and getting past emotional trauma while also saving the world in the process. <br>
It has a lot more narrative weight than i ever thought it would have, the impact on my soul will be remembered forever.<br>
The soundtrack is great, the comedy is on point. Go play it dummy!</p><br>

<a href="https://www.katawa-shoujo.online/">>Katawa Shoujo</a><br>
<img src="katawa_shoujo.webp" alt="Katawa Shoujo" class="center"> 

<p>
    A game i didn't expect for me to like, seeing that i mostly play Yuri or Lesbian Visual Novels.
    However, Katawa shoujo managed to surprise me so, so much.<br><br>
    First off, it's a miracle this game came out this way, it was made from random 4chan contributors
    in the early days of indie gaming. <br>
    Somehow, it really does not feel like a 4chan creation. It genuinely has some of the
    most heartfelt and respectful discussion and exploration into disability and disabled people
    that i've seen in a game.<br><br>
    The protagonist, Hisao, is a fully colored character, instead of a cardboard self-insert,
    and his long self-reflections on how he feels about being disabled and how it changes
    his view of both himself and the friends and potential lover around him still haunts me in a good way.<br><br>
    Go play it, it's completely free, has fan mobile ports, but be wary of the optional NSFW content.
