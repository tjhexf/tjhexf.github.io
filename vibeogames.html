<h1>Jolene's Favorite Videogames List!</h1>
<p>This is a super minimal html like just some bytes, so i can store my favorite games list :3</p>

<p>Not Actually Ordered by the way, i'm just placing games as i go along and remember or play them</p>

<p>The List:</p><br>

<a href="https://ponett.itch.io/slarpg">>Super Lesbian Animal RPG</a><br>
<img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzEwMTAzNDEzLnBuZw==/original/%2BNCrQB.png" alt="Super Lesbian Animal RPG LOGO" class="center"> 

<p>A great, longer than i expected, RPG about Lesbian Animals going on adventures and getting past emotional trauma while also saving the world in the process. <br>
It has a lot more narrative weight than i ever thought it would have, the impact on my soul will be remembered forever.<br>
The soundtrack is great, the comedy is on point. Go play it dummy!</p>
