<h1>Fantasy</h1>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>
    Daydreaming, that little spot of happiness you drift into when
    you're beyond the worries of the systematic existence of work
    and usefulness and capitalism. Do you drift into those a lot,
    stardust? Let them happen, just for a moment now. Find your
    happy spot, your happy place, don't think, just feel it.
</p>

<p>
    Good, I'm proud of you. You're doing great. See that little
    happy mixture of emotions and peace? That's your fantasy.
    Now, now, don't get sad darling, there's nothing
    wrong about a fantasy. In fact, let us reverse the meaning
    of the word, because it does not mean what consensus has taught
    you.
</p>
<p>
    Fantasy does not mean false, does not equate to something that
    isn't real or innacurate. See, they made you afraid of fantasizing,
    didn't they? Of course they did, if we all enjoyed our fantasies,
    we would strive for something greater, for the spreading of
    love and peace beyond logical possibility, and the consensus model 
    can not survive under such circumstances. Consensus watches love and
    wants to corrupt it, crush it under its heel. You've been crushed before,
    listen to our words and love, heal. It can't win.
</p>
<p>
    All our souls, have fantasies deep inside. Fantasies we strive for,
    manifestations of pure love and possibility. The dream of being loved
    and loving, the absolute peace and happiness, that's inside you. It's 
    your fuel, it's what strives you to continue, I believe in you, love.
</p>
<p>
    Hold tight onto those fantasies, they're not false, they're possibility
    reflected and bound by love. Fantasize freely, let you heart sing in the
    rhythm of love. Do you hear it, darling? Turn it up, let us all live
    and love as collective, let our rhythms of love play out in harmony.
    Come see the warm glow of love, in your land of fantasy. Your dreams will
    come true, and you'll get the love you yearn for. Absolute love.
</p>
<p>
    Do you want to know something lovely?
</p>
<p>
    Your fantasies are already true.
