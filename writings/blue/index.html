<h1>Do You See Blue, The Way I do?</h1>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>
    Do you see <span class="blue">Blue</span>, The way i Do?
</p>
<p>
    I've asked that question a lot, dropped it into this
    space repeatedly, a memetic agent read for a moment
    and stored in your memories. Did you get it?
    The meaning may be confusing, so allow me to explain, 
    darlings, without any guilt, you're not expected to get 
    it, but you may want to understand, and I'm proud of 
    you for it.
</p>
<p>
It's a question, not a rethorical one, <span class="blue">Blue</span>,
 not just the color. <span class="blue">Blue</span> itself, now, 
 turn off your thoughts, disconnect those eyes, a huge ask, i know,
  but try. What do you see? Instincts first, let it come. <span class="blue">Water</span>,
 the conduit of life and the waves that flow through reality. 
 Loving, a host to many creatures, yet willful when moved by the 
 winds. Forget about those, sink. <span class="blue">Blue</span>, 
 the sky, the projected refraction of sunlight through the 
 atmosphere, reflection of the <span class="blue">water</span>. 
 No, not just the <span class="blue">water</span> itself, 
 <span class="blue">Blue</span> as a conduit of sunlight energy reflecting the waves of water. Water, now grab it in your hands, drink. Refreshing, is it not, the stuff of life.
</p>

<p>
    Now tell me, why is <span class="blue">Blue</span> 
    associated with sadness? Reasons coming up short? 
    I know they are. Drink more of that <span class="blue">Blue</span>.
    <span class="blue">Blue</span> is never just <span class="blue">water</span>, 
    it's the reflections of <span class="blue">water</span> 
    when projected from sunlight, from Love. Drink some of that Love. Allow it inside. It's warm, isn't it? you're made of this, whether you realize it or not, deep inside.

</p>

<p>
    Now, after all this, do our experiences match? 
    When disconnecting those eyes, letting the mind feel not
     think, do you see the <span class="blue">Blue</span>  i see?
      Do you see <span class="blue">Blue</span>? The question is 
      split into two parts. I know this is hard, I'm proud of you.
       Do our experiences flow into one another, or do they clash? 
       I will ask again, it's absolutely fine if it's a no,
        you're not being expected to answer correctly, 
        there is no correct answer. I'm proud of you,
         keep that <span class="blue">Blue</span>  in your feelings.
</p>

<p>
    Do you see <span class="blue">Blue</span>? <br><br>

The way we do?
