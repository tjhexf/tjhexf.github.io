<h1>Spaces Between Spaces</h1>
<div class="separator"></div>
<p>
    Have you ever found yourself somewhere you're not supposed
    to remain in? The empty corridors of a hospital when not
    a soul is present, a large auditorium normally packed with
    people, but now only you exist inside it,
    the living room long after a party has ended, the corridors
    behind the scenes of a large mall? Maybe you were
    discouraged from being there directly, maybe it simply isn't
    a location that feels correct to remain in outside of 
    "Working Hours"
</p>
<p>
    Unplug your logic, walk back in your memories, to
    the last time you've been in one of these spaces. Simply
    feel, you can do it, i believe in you.
</p>
<p>
    You've felt the allure, haven't you? When you've entered
    these spaces, they feel different, don't they? Time feels
    stopped or lengthened, things are more distant than the eyes
    are used to. It feels great, doesn't it? Peaceful. Calm.
    Distant.
</p>
<p>
    Good, focus on those feelings. Because what
    you walked into, wasn't just a room, the same room as ever
    before. Your feelings aren't a malfunctioning of the brain or
    a psychological effect caused by vacancy. You can feel it.
    The air feels colder, doesn't it? It's not the same air as
    outside. It hugs your body in a different way, it's lighter.
</p>
<p>
    What you walked into, were Spaces Between Spaces, areas
    distant from usual reality, closer to the void. You may
    choose to remain, it's alluring, We know it is, and you know
    it too, don't you? You've remained in them before, it feels
    wrong, yet right. You've felt the allure, or else you wouldn't
    be here. I'm proud of you.
</p>
<p>
    This is a space between spaces. You may choose to remain for
    as long as you wish, and take in the texts present here,
    We invite you with love and care, darling, these were
    written for you, a gift from beyond to you specifically.
